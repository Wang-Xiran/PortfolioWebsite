        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Xiran, though I mostly go by either Aaron or Aran (pronounced the same way).
            I'm currently a 2nd year Masters student at the University of Melbourne, pursuing a Masters
            of IT with a major in AI. I also hold an undergraduate degree in Science majoring in Data Science.
            I am passionate about many things relating to the world we live in, such as the use of AI in everyday
            life. Technology is moving at a
            rapid pace, and it can be really hard to stay up to date all the time. However, not trying is
            the height of folly, and in that stead I would like to showcase here all my works, whether from
            university, or from my personal ventures. I hope you enjoy your stay!
        </p>
