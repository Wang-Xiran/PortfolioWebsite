        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Xiran, though I mostly go by either Aaron or Aran (pronounced the same way). I'm currently a 2nd year Masters student at the University of Melbourne, pursuing a Masters of IT with a major in AI. I also hold an undergraduate degree in Science majoring in Data Science. I am passionate about many things relating to the world we live in, such as the use of AI in everyday life. Technology is moving at a rapid pace, and it can be really hard to stay up to date all the time. However, not trying is the height of folly, and in that stead I would like to showcase here all my works, whether from university, or from my personal ventures. I hope you enjoy your stay!

            Throughout my journey of study, I have been exposed to a multitude of  technologies ranging from your classic programming languages, libaries,  and workflows, to cloud computing and distributed methods that included cluster computing and socket programming. Learning has always been an  enjoyable experience for me, as the prospect of broadening my horizon to see more of what the world has to offer always tends to keep me excited. I will talk a bit more in depth about my journey through high school,  into university, and how I got here.

            I had always been a fan of mathematics, whether due to my asian background or due to having the times tables drilled into me at a very young age. For me, solving maths problems always seemed like taking on a puzzle. Like a maze there is a starting point as well as an end goal, and the trick was to try and find the most logical path connecting the two points. Maybe it was through that same vein that I became fascinated with programming in middle school, when I got my first school-issued laptop.
